                    There are problems with urban development in Kiev and many others post-soviet cities. The deficiency of modern city evolution plans is highly noticeable and becomes a real problem. To name reasons why it is so, we have to mention insufficient budget funds, corruption, lack of knowledge about issues that people face daily, and the biggest one - bureaucratic mechanisms of municipal services and departments that are hard to understand and hard to work with for common people.

                    Our project - Splace gives opportunity to change that. We want citizens to be able to collaborate and define city infrastructure themselves. We want save them from bureaucracy, provide easy-to-use tools and experience of engaging. We believe such bottom-up approach will boost urban development, provide data on peopleâ€™s needs, save money and solve real issues with current infrastructure.

                    Splace is a mobile application that allows to donate money and collect petitions or votes for installing small infrastructure elements in specific places across the city. Our app is a powerful tool for shaping the public space.

                    First, choose a point on the map where you want to see an infrastructure element. Then choose the type of element that you want to install (bicycle parking, bench, trash can, grass lawn etc.). After that start a small crowdfunding project for sponsoring the element that you want to see in this place. Anyone can donate money and vote for every project on the map. Finally, when the required amount of money is collected, we make an agreement with the municipal service and install the desired element.
